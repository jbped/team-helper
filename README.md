## Description
Team Helper is an HTML page generator for Software Engineering Teams. It is designed to allow a user to provide a manager, engineers, and interns for a specific team. By answering a variety of command line questions, the answers are assimilated into an HTML file that can be added to a webpage to display among other teams.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository 
2. Open command line in the appropriate directory 
3. Enter the following command: ```npm i```

## Usage
Complete the installation steps. Once the installation steps have been completed initate the command prompts by entering ```node index``` in an active command terminal. This will initiate the questions. Answer each question to the best of your ability. Once all questions have been answered a team organization HTML file will be generated and saved to the /dist folder. Note that any new file generated will overwrite the previous file. Be sure to copy and save it to another location prior to generating a new file.
